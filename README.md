# SimpsonsNeuralNetwork
The final project of CMPE 452. The purpose of this project was tackle a practical problem by constructing several neural networks and comparing their effectiveness to determine the best solution. Our team devised methods of identifying different cartoon characters in frames from the show: The Simpsons.

This repository contains the project report and the four models in Python, KNIME (using a LeNet and a AlexNet) and Matlab, but does not contain the training and test sets used in the project due to their size. The images used were initially collected and cateogorized by alexattia, https://github.com/alexattia/SimpsonRecognition.git.
